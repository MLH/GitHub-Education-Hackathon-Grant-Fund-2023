# hackUMBC 2022
hackUMBC is a 24-hour collegiate level hackathon hosted by the undergraduates at UMBC, a prestigious R1
research university. We bring together hundreds of students and recent graduates across the East Coast to develop and pitch interdisciplinary projects they build over a weekend. hackUMBC encourages student-hackers of diverse backgrounds and levels of experience to learn by collaborating and creating! Students are given the opportunity to show off what they've built over the 24-hours. Projects are judged for a chance to win prizes to reinforce their learning endeavors! 


This year’s theme was an “80’s Retro Arcade”! We included elements of the 80’s technology and synthwave elements to enhance hacker experience, thanks to our sponsors such as the GitHub Fund! We wanted to inspire our hackers to think about the future while taking inspiration  from the booming tech scene of the 80’s. Our students were encouraged to develop in various tracks set by us but also to explore outside into a realm of possibilities. The 80’s were a time of eclectic expression and we had a goal of sharing this reflection as students think about the innovations of the future. 🌃 🚇 🚦 ✨


## ⚡️ Event Summary

Hackers had opportunities to explore their curiosities and take breaks with us throughout the weekend. Whether they were busy networking with people, learning new skills, or exploring their creative side with our fun activities, hackers had plenty to do! 

Hackers had an opportunity to attend 9 workshops, an MLH mini-event, annual smash tournament and our midnight glow-stick dance party! We had a beginner hardware workshop hosted by our IEEE chapter. We also hosted other beginner friendly workshops like the Intro to APIs, Github and Python Game Development! One of our favorite on-theme additions to the event were the arcade games that hackers could play, they were a hit!

## 💰 Impact of GitHub Grant

Our focus this year was increased accessibility to the event, we wanted to increase the attendance of students who are trying to get a headstart into the hackathon community and those who come from HBCU backgrounds. We hosted a bus that brought ~40 students from Howard University to the event. We also had a larger percentage of high school students compared to previous years. Our event was fully in-person this year after many years and we wanted to improve our hacker experience. We were able to include well balanced food options for a variety of dietary restrictions, offer accessible communications to our mentors both in person and on our discord platform. We were able to invest in hacker experience details such thanks to the funds from the GitHub Education Grant.
