# ROBOHackIT
 - **October 22-23, 2022** 
 - **A Digital Hackathon Hosted by Robinson Secondary School**
 - **Fairfax Virginia, USA**  

## Event Summary
At Robinson, there are a lot of clever, inventive, brilliant students who haven't realized that they're the minds and change our community is waiting for. There are also others who've just started on the wrong foot or don't have the resources or opportunity to further their study at home and practice new material. 

ROBOHackIT wants to connect to students like this at Robinson Secondary and around the world and show them what they can do. We plan to have talks and workshops with industry professionals so that students can see what their careers might look like after high school, and develop the skills to make the journey. 

ROBOHackIT's theme this year is education, so while these students learn about career options and practice design thinking and programming, they will also create apps and solutions to lift up other kids around the world. 

In our own small way, we hope ROBOHackIt encourages students to explore their horizons (and maybe even push them) while thinking about how they can support others in their community and bridge gaps in education overall.

## Impact of GitHub Grant
	
We first gravitated towards a low-to-no-cost hackathon, to keep things simple, workable, and legal for our student organizers as members of a school club.

As we continued developing our event, we decided that new and returning hackers deserve to be recognized and rewarded for their hard work during our hackathon. To motivate students in our community to give coding or design a shot, we'd need some prizes. 
Our budget is dedicated to overall and track prizes for students, including Most Creative, Best Design, Best Beginner Hack, and Best Education Hack. 

These separate tracks will encourage students from different backgrounds, who might be new to coding, to participate still and challenge themselves.
