## Event Summary

Who are we? EcoHacks is an ONLINE hackathon that aims to find sustainable solutions to some of the world’s greatest environmental challenges. 
<br/>
Participants can collaborate and meet new people, find and form teams in our discord server, and with the help of our half hour team bonding session at the start of our event. 
<br />
We had three workshops, building a basic website, creating an iOS app in Swift, building simple AI models & the mathematical ideas behind them respectively.
In addition, we have presentations from two guest speakers, one on empowering Women in STEM as well as walking through the journey of founding her two startups,
and the other on countering global warming and sea level rise, pursuing innovative and technological fixes to save the environment.
Furthermore, we also have three more mini-events from our sponsors, a talk on enhancing our productivity from co-founder of Centered, 
a recording from Echo3D on AR/VR technology, and a CTF (capture the flag) cybersecurity challenge from Synk.
<br />
For submission, we require participants to link their project's Github repository to their submission page if possible. This not only helped us finding suspicius projects through the commit history,
but also allowed an easy to navigate user interface for us to look at the way people write code. Moreover, with the help of MLH (Major League Hacking), we have
an special award on "Best Use of Github" that we advertised in our opening and closing ceremony slides.

## Impact of GitHub Grant
- Due to communication issues from both ends, we did not manage to receive the funds during the hackathon. However, we did annouce the GitHub Grant through our social medias, this allowed us to attract more participants.

## Top Projects

- There were quite handful of cool projects that we think deserves recognition:
- [1](https://devpost.com/software/recycleai-v1dqz5) While we were expecting people to create projects that are produced digitally, our hackathon's 1st place award went to a group of high school students that built a physical trash bin using AI to smart filter recyclable and non-renewable wastes. <br> 
- [2](https://devpost.com/software/covid-spread-stimulation) This won our Best Covid-19 special award. Taking covid analyse to the next level by producing a simulation website hosted on GitHub Page in a GitHub repository for their team's git code.
- [3](https://devpost.com/software/splastic) The project is about projection of trash flow from a global perspective. The wonderful idea, intuitive UI, and its good design won it the second place.
- [4](https://devpost.com/software/waste-eraser) Winning project for the 3rd Best Beginner Special Award. Although the team is a set of beginners, the final project was show with effort and skill.

## What’s Next?
- We planned our first ever hackathon EcoHacks 2022 in the span of three months. From asking for sponsors, finding judges, to inviting guest speakers, the entire organizing process is a thrill ride with intense up and downs. 
  Thanks to the GitHub Grant and MLH, we are able to give winning teams more attractive prizes and allow our hackathon to finish vigorously. <br>
- With the huge success of our first hackathon. We plan to host EcoHacks again next year in 2023 at similar time periods August - September. We wish through the experience we learned from our first hackathon event, we will make our next even more stimulating. <br>
