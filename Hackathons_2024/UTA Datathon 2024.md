Impact of GitHub Grant

The GitHub grant was used to purchase the snacks for the hackers to keep them energized and sustained throughout the event. Since we were low on budget, we were unable to purchase all the snacks that would be much needed throughtout the day.

How did the funds positively affect the outcomes of your event participants? 
Because the of funds, we were able to purchase snacks and that caused us to a) comply with the MLH reccommendation of providing snacks.
b) It also kept the hackers motivated especially during the late hours at night and while trying to win minevent prizes example: a cheese ball tub.


We had some very interesting submissions especially for the visualization challenges under the Vision Quest challenge, and the submission that was made for the Drama Llamma Traffic Jamma challenge after TBs of data proccessing.
