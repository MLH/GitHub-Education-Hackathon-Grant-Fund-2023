## Event Summary

- The event brought together 350 innovative minds, including students, professionals, and coding enthusiasts. The attendees participated in a plethora of activities ranging from coding challenges to workshops and fun events.
We had a variety of mini-events such as a resume roast, typing contest, and workshops such as Intro to Cohere, LLM and real-world application. Throughout the weekend hackers were encouraged to work on projects they felt passionate about and to try networking, meet new people and have fun.
Github was essential in our hackathon as we required all project submissions to be submit their Github repositories.

## Impact of GitHub Grant
Our team would not have been able to host our event without the help of the GitHub Grant. It was a big help since we had a sponsor pull out last minute and were tight on funding. Ultimately allowed us to support more hackers than we expected. Ultimately, we spent our grant money on snacks and drinks for our hackers Saturday afternoon.

## Top Projects

- We had tons of amazing projects at MetHacks, but we did need to narrow it down and select some top projects to award prizes to. Some of our favorite projects were;
- [point-dpt, Everyone](https://devpost.com/software/point-dpt) - The only documented instance of an open-source pointer software that utilizes the position of the user's index finger to ascertain the specific location on the screen they are pointing towards
- [narratorRL](https://devpost.com/software/narratorrl) - Image to text to speech app with LLM and AI enhanced features.
- [PaperOrchestra](https://devpost.com/software/paper-ochestra) - PaperOrchestra is a video call app where users can join the call and play instruments virtually using their hands
- [PhishGuard](https://devpost.com/software/phishguard) -A simple and intuitive application which analyzes selected browser text and identifies malicious phishing content.
