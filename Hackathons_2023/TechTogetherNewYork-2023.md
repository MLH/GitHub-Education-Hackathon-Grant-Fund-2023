## Impact of GitHub Grant
- How did you use the grant funds? <br>
These funds directly impacted the ability of the event to get food that met the dietary restrictions of hackers. There were hackers who did not fill out their registration form correctly so we had to get unplanned meals to cover their dietary restrictions the day of the event.
